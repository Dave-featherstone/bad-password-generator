# Bad Password Generator

**DO NOT USE THIS APP FOR ANY REAL LIFE PURPOSE**

A Go App with some vulnerabilities to help demonstrate the use of DevSecOps tools

Contains examples of:
- Hard Coded Passwords (in the file and in the git history)
- Vulnerable dependancies
- Insecure Coding

Also it's a stupid idea for an app as well and I'm a very poor coder.

The intention of this app is so you can demonstrate the use of such tools as:
- [Trufflehog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/truffleHog)
- [Nancy](https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/nancy)
- [GoSec](https://github.com/securego/gosec)
